# Welcome to My Awesome Website!

This is the homepage of a website generated entirely by a Python script.

## How it works

The generator script does the following:
1.  Reads Markdown files from the `content/` directory.
2.  Converts the Markdown to HTML.
3.  Injects the HTML content into a template.
4.  Saves the final result as `.html` files in the `dist/` directory.
